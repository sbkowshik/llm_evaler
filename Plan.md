# Pype AI/ML Engineer Assignment 

## 1. Understanding EvalGen's Core Algorithm

EvalGen helps users generate and validate evaluation criteria for LLM outputs through:

1. Criteria suggestion (using LLMs to propose evaluation metrics)
2. Candidate assertion generation (implementing these criteria as code or LLM prompts)
3. Human validation (aligning assertions with human preferences)
4. Selection of most aligned assertions based on user feedback

**REQUIRED  - Proper understanding of the concept of the research paper**

## 2. Implementation Plan

### `Step 1: Set Up Basic Framework`

Create a simplified version of the EvalGen architecture,
Implement the three core components.


### `Step 2: Dataset Selection`

### `Step 3: Implementation Details`

1. Build Criteria Suggestion System

2. Implement Assertion Generator

3. Create Feedback Collection Mechanism

4. Implement Selection Algorithm


## 3. Evaluation Strategy
Comparison of the performance against benchmarks
